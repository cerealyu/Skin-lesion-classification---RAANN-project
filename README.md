# Skin-lesion-classification---RAANN-project

Hi Peter,

Since my project contained 6 files in total, I thought it would be easy for you to have a look at this repository so you do not have to download all 6 files. 

The skeleton for all the above files is the same, the only difference is how I constructed the model. 
Please refer to the 1_Standard_CNN and 5_InceptionResnetV2 for detailed explanation of the code. 

The dataset used in my project is from the following link: https://challenge2019.isic-archive.com/data.html

Enjoy your read and please do not hesitate to contact me for any information. :)
